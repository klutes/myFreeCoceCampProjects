        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Joseph Smith Jr.'s life:</h3>
        <li><strong>1805</strong> - Joseph Smith Jr. is born in Vermont, United States</li>
        <li><strong>1812</strong> - Undergoes an experimental surgery to remove diseased bone without the use of alcohol as an anesthetic. The surgeon had to cut open his leg, cut the muscle and literally chip or cut away at parts of the diseased bone. He used crutches for 3 years after this surgery and had a limp the rest of his life.</li>
        <li><strong>1820</strong> - Confused about competing and contradicting religious doctrines, Joseph decided to put James' words to the literal test and ask God in prayer which religion was true. He received a glorious vision of God the Father and His Son Jesus Christ who told him that none of them were true, but that through him the fulness of Jesus Christ's gospel truth would be restored to the Earth.</li>
        <li><strong>1823</strong> - One evening, while praying, Joseph was visited by an angel named Moroni who told him further details about his restorative work and instructed him to visit a specific location on a nearby hillside where he could find an ancient record engraved on metal plates.</li>
        <li><strong>September 1827</strong> - Joseph Smith retrieved the ancient record to begin its translation through the power of God and revelation.</li>
        <li><strong>March 1830</strong> - The Book of Mormon was published in Palmyra</li>
        <li><strong>April 1830</strong> - The Church of Christ, later renamed The Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, was founded and the true church of Jesus Christ was restored with all the proper keys and authority of the Priesthood of God.</li>
        <li><strong>1838</strong> - The members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (<a href="#misnomer">commonly and incorrectly referred to as 'Mormons'*</a>) were forcibly evicted from their property and a Governor's order was signed to either exterminate or drive them from Missouri. </li>
        <li><strong>October 1838</strong> - An armed party of Missourians surprised and murdered seventeen Saints at Haun's Mill.</li>
        <li><strong>1838-1839</strong> - Joseph Smith and others were jailed in Liberty, Missouri for several months awaiting trial.</li>
        <li><strong>23 June, 1844</strong> - Joseph Smith and brother Hyrum were imprisoned in Carthage Jail.
          <li><strong>27 June, 1844</strong> - A blackened-faced mob stormed the jail and shot and killed both Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum. Their murderers stood trial but were acquitted of any wrongdoing.</li>
        </ul>

          <p>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. </p>

          <h3>Religious or not, <a href="https://www.lds.org/topics/joseph-smith?lang=eng" id="tribute-link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you should read more about this incredible man</a>.
            <br>Through his faithful efforts, we have modern scripture, modern revelation and restored authority.<br>I believe that the fullness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ was restored through him and that we can readily find answers to life's burning questions: Who are we? What happened before birth/being on Earth? What happens after death?
